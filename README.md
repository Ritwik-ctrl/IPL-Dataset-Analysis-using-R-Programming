# IPL-Dataset-Analysis-using-R-Programming
This project aims to analyse data using R-Programming language. Considering I'm a huge cricket fan, the dataset chosen is IPL which has been downloaded from Kaggle. 
It aims to analyse:
1. Which Over Has The Highest Probability Of A Wicket?
2. Do Batters Score More In Powerplay Or Death Overs?
3. Does A Batterâ€™s Strike Rate Change As They Face More Balls?
4. Does The Probability Of Scoring A Boundary Depend On The Over Number?

While I did it on posit.cloud, I would advise you to do as follows:
1. Upload dataset in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format from bottom right "Upload" option
2. deliveries <- read.csv("IPL_Dataset.csv")
//to read the dataset
3. names(deliveries)
//to extract column names in a way to correctly align your code with the columns

The dataset has 17 columns and 260921 rows.
